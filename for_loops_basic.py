# Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.

# for x in range(0, 151, 1):
#     print(x)
    
# Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000

# for x in range(5, 10001, 5):
#     print(x)

# Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.

# sum = 0
# for x in range(0, 500001, 1):
#     sum=sum+x
# print(sum)

# Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.

# for x in range(2018, 0, -4):
#     print(x)

# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# def flexible_counter(low, high, mult):
#     for x in range(low, high+1, 1):
#         if x % mult ==0:
#             print(x)

# flexible_counter(2, 9, 3)
